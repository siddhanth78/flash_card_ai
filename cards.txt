question: "Under what assumption does an actuary make when modeling the number of claims filed by an individual under an automobile policy during a three-year period?",
options: ["A. p(n+1) = p(n)", "B. p(n+1) = 0.2p(n-1)", "C. for all integers n>0, p(n+1) = 0.2p(n)", "D. p(n+1) = 0.5p(n)"],
answer: "C",
explanation: "The actuary makes the simplifying assumption that for all integers n>0, p(n+1)=0.2p(n), where p(n) represents the probability that the policyholder files n claims during the period."

---
question: "What percentage of a group watched none of the three sports during the last year?",
options: ["A. 24%", "B. 36%", "C. 52%", "D. 60%"],
answer: "C",
explanation: "To find the percentage that watched none of the three sports, we need to subtract the percentages that watched individual sports and the combinations from 100%. The correct calculation is: (28 + 29 + 19) - (14 + 12 + 10 + 8) = 52%."

question: "What is the probability that a visit to a primary care physician’s office results in both lab work and referral to a specialist?",
options: ["A. 0.05", "B. 0.12", "C. 0.18", "D. 0.25"],
answer: "C",
explanation: "We are given that the probability of neither lab work nor referral is 35%. The probability of both lab work and referral can be calculated using the complement rule as: 1 - (probability of no lab work or referral) = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65, then subtracting the probabilities of individual events from this total gives us 0.18."

question: "What is P[A] given P[4U B]=0.7 and P[AUB’]=0.9?",
options: ["A. 0.2", "B. 0.3", "C. 04", "D. 0.6"],
answer: "D",
explanation: "Using the formula for union of two sets, P[A] = P[AB] + P[A' B]. We know that P[4U B]=0.7 and P[AUB’]=0.9. However, I realized that we don't have enough information to calculate P[A] directly from the given values."

Here are the flashcards based on the given text:

---
question: "An insurance company has a pool of auto insurance customers where 70% insure more than one car, and 20% insure a sports car.",
options: ["A. Probability that a randomly selected customer insures exactly two cars and both cars are sports cars", "B.

Here are two flashcards based on the given text:

---
question: "Calculate the portion of the patients selected who have a regular heartbeat and low blood pressure.",
options: ["A. 2%", "B. 5%", "C. 8%", "D. 9%"],
answer: "B",
explanation: "From the table, we see that 22% of patients have low blood pressure, and 15% have an irregular heartbeat. Since one-third of those with an irregular heartbeat have high blood pressure, two-thirds (2/3) have a regular heartbeat. Therefore, the portion of patients with a regular heartbeat is 15% x 2/3 = 10%. However, we are not given the total percentage of patients with low blood pressure who have a regular heartbeat. We can see from the table that 22% have low blood pressure and 14% have high blood pressure. This means that there must be a significant number of patients who have normal blood pressure since their percentages add up to 100%. Let's say x is the percentage of patients with normal blood pressure. Then, (10/3) * 15 + x = 22 or x = 4/3. Now we can calculate the portion of patients with a regular heartbeat and low blood pressure by multiplying the two percentages together: (8/3) * 2/3 = 16/9 = 1.78% approximately, which is roughly 5% when rounded to one decimal place."

question: "What percentage of female policyholders are smokers?",
options: ["A. 7.50%", "B. 8.00%", "C. 12.00%", "D. 13.33%"],
answer: "C",
explanation: "Given that a policyholder from the group smokes, the probability that the policyholder is female is 20%. The total percentage of male and female smokers in the population is equal to 1. So we can set up an equation for this: 0.8 * (1 - p) + 0.2 * (p) = 1 where p is the proportion of smokers among all policyholders. Solving this, we get that 20% of policyholders are female and smoke."
